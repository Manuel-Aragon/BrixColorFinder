BrixColor Finder is an innovative app that uses machine learning models to empower visually impaired individuals by accurately identifying the color and type of individual LEGO bricks. Developed for both iOS and Android devices, the app enhances the LEGO building experience for users with various visual impairments, promoting inclusivity and fostering social interactions.
While people with visual impairments can enjoy building with LEGOs, challenges in determining brick shape and color may arise due to their impairments. BrixColor Finder addresses these challenges with its unique focus on LEGO brick identification, combined with its use of image recognition technology and LEGO-specific databases. The app is also compatible with phone screen readers, providing a more comprehensive tool for users.
By bridging the accessibility gap in the world of LEGO, BrixColor Finder has the potential to benefit not only visually impaired individuals, but also educators, therapists, and parents working with them.
